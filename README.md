# Adaptive Task Planner Agent

**Developer: Rana Karmakar (Gen AI Engineer)**

A simple, clean AI agent built with **LangGraph 1.0** that demonstrates intelligent task planning, execution simulation, reflection, and dynamic replanning capabilities.

## Overview

This project showcases a production-ready AI agent architecture that:
- **Plans tasks** intelligently based on deadlines and time constraints
- **Simulates execution** by completing tasks one at a time
- **Reflects on progress** to identify unfinished work
- **Replans dynamically** when tasks remain incomplete

The agent follows a continuous improvement loop, adapting its approach based on execution results.

## Why LangGraph 1.0?

LangGraph 1.0 was chosen for this project because it provides:

- **Stable Core APIs**: Production-ready with unchanged graph primitives and execution model
- **Stateful Workflows**: Maintains context across multiple planning cycles with built-in checkpointing
- **Graph-Based Orchestration**: Natural modeling of decision points and transitions
- **Durable Execution**: Built-in persistence, streaming, and human-in-the-loop patterns
- **Seamless Integration**: Works hand-in-hand with LangChain 1.0 for high-level to low-level control

## Agent Architecture

The agent consists of four main components working in a cycle:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│ plan_tasks  │───▶│ execute_day │───▶│   reflect   │
│             │    │             │    │             │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └──────┬──────┘
       ▲                                     │
       │           ┌─────────────┐           ▼
       └───────────│   replan    │◀──────[feedback?]
                   │             │
                   └─────────────┘           │
                                            ▼
                                         [ END ]
```

### Components

1. **plan_tasks**: Creates daily schedule based on deadlines (up to 8 hours)
2. **execute_day**: Simulates completing the first task in the plan
3. **reflect**: Analyzes progress and identifies unfinished work
4. **replan**: Moves incomplete tasks back for future planning

## Graph Flow

The LangGraph workflow follows this decision tree:

```
START
  │
  ▼
plan_tasks ──────────────────────────────────┐
  │                                          │
  ▼                                          │
execute_day                                  │
  │                                          │
  ▼                                          │
reflect                                      │
  │                                          │
  ├─[no feedback]──────────────▶ END         │
  │                                          │
  └─[has feedback]──────────────┐            │
                                │            │
                                ▼            │
                              replan         │
                                │            │
                                └────────────┘
```

**Decision Logic:**
- `reflect → END`: When all planned tasks are complete
- `reflect → replan`: When tasks remain unfinished
- `replan → execute_day`: Continue the cycle with replanned tasks

## Example Run

```bash
$ python main.py
